== Kickstart files

Kickstart files are files which describe how the system must be installed, partitions, packages to be installed, users, configuration ...

Each time we install a RHEL system using the installation DVD after the installation process finishes a kickstart file is stored in the root HOME directory with the installation we have just performed under the path /root/anaconda-ks.cfg.
