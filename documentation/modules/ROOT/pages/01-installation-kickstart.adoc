== Kickstart files

Kickstart files are files which describe how the system must be installed, partitions, packages to be installed, users, configuration ...

Each time we install a RHEL system using the installation DVD after the installation process finishes a kickstart file is stored in the root HOME directory with the installation we have just performed under the path https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadebustos/workshops-rhel9/master/documentation/modules/ROOT/assets/files/kickstart/anaconda-ks.cfg[/root/anaconda-ks.cfg].

== Creating our customized Kickstart files

We can use a kickstart file from a previous installation and adapt it to the new installation.

TIP: You can use the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html-single/performing_an_advanced_rhel_9_installation/index[Red Hat 9 Official Documentation] if you do not become confortable with Kickstart files.
