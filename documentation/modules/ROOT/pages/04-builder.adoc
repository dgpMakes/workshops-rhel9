[#imagebuilder]
== Create RHEL images to deploy everywhere

**Cockpit** needs to be installed and running. If **cockpit** is not installed check xref:02-management.adoc#installingcockpit[Installing cockpit].

To create RHEL images we will use **image builder**.

[#installingbuilder]
== Installing image builder

To install **image builder** we will install the cockpit add-on:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[root@rhel9 ~]# dnf install osbuild-composer composer-cli cockpit-composer bash-completion -y
...
[root@rhel9 ~]# systemctl enable --now osbuild-composer.socket
[root@rhel9 ~]#

Reload your browser:

== Blueprints

Before deploying an image we need to define the image, the content, ... this is named **blueprint**.

Clicking in **blueprint** we will be asked for a name and description for the image:..

image::builder/01-create-blueprint.png[]

After creation we could add the packages we want to be installed in the image:..

image::builder/02-create-blueprint.png[]

Select all the packages you want to install and press **Commit**:

image::builder/03-create-blueprint.png[]

After confirming the **commit** operation:

image::builder/04-create-blueprint.png[]

Now you can create the image clicking on **Create image** but if we click on the **image name**:

image::builder/05-create-blueprint.png[]

we can customize the image:

image::builder/06-create-blueprint.png[]

* We can configure the hostname.
* We can configure the device where the image will be installed (if neeeed).
* We can create users.

If we click on **Create user account**:

image::builder/07-create-blueprint.png[]

Now we have created an user within the image:

image::builder/08-create-blueprint.png[]

We can create as many as needed.

To create the image we can go to the **Images** tab and click on **Create image**:

image::builder/09-create-blueprint.png[]

Now we can select the format of the image. So we can create an iso installer, an Amazon Image, an image for vSphere, OpenStack, ...

image::builder/10-create-blueprint.png[]

After selecting the format click on **Create** to create the image:

image::builder/11-create-blueprint.png[]

It will take a while to create the image:
