== Deploying containers
In this section we will see how to deploy and run containers in RHEL 9.

You will need a running RHEL 9 machine.

We will use two different users in this machine:

* The **workshop** user where we will create the container images.
* The **core** user where we will run the containers.

TIP: Pay attention to the commandline prompts to know the user you are working with.

NOTE: This container workshop can be performed both RHEL 9 and RHEL 9 Edge.
