== Blueprints vs Images

It is important to know the differences between them.

A blueprint is an image definition:

* Packages included in the image.
* Users included in the image.
* Configuration included in the image.

A blueprint can not be deployed or installed itself.

An image is a blueprint converted to a deployable format:

* ISO.
* Amazon image.
* Azure image.
* OpenStack QCOW2.
* RHV QCOW2.
* vSphere VMDK.

A blueprint can be downloaded as any Image Builder supported format as image. So we will create a blueprint and that same blueprint could be used to deploy an Amazon instance or Azure one.
