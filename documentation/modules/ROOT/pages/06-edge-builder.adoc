== Deployment for RHEL in the Edge using Image Builder

This method offers you more control over the Edge image creation.

First of all you will have to deploy a RHEL server installing:

1. Cockpit (xref:02-management.adoc[RHEL Managament]).
2. Image Builder (xref:04-builder.adoc[Image Builder]).

When **Cockpit** and the **Image Builder** service are installed connect to Cockpit and go to Image Builder and create a blueprint for your Edge deployment as indicated in xref:04-builder-blueprints.adoc[Blueprints].

=== Deploying a commited image

Once the blueprint has been created we need to create an image for the blueprint, in this case select **RHEL for Edge Commit (.tar)**:

image::edge-deployment/commit-01.png[]

And click on **Create**:

image::edge-deployment/commit-02.png[]

After the image creation we can download it:

image::edge-deployment/commit-04.png[]

TIP: We can download the image using the command line: xref:04-builder-cmdline.adoc[Using Image Builder from the command line].

As we can see we have two different images for the same template:

1. An ISO image.
2. The Commit tar image.

TIP: Once we have a blueprint we can create different images for different platforms using the same blueprint.

We need to publish the image using a http server so as explained in xref:01-installation-repositories.adoc[Network repositories] we deploy Apache and we will create a directory to publish the image:..

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[root@rhel9 ~]# cd /var/www/html
[root@rhel9 html]# mkdir ostree

We uncompress the image in that directory:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[root@rhel9 html]# tar xf /root/8a987451-c840-45b0-af12-3b3f575b5fd6-commit.tar -C /var/www/html/ostree
[root@rhel9 html]# ls -lhZ /var/www/html/ostree
total 4.0K
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root unconfined_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0 553 Aug 24 15:53 compose.json
drwxr-xr-x. 7 root root unconfined_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0 102 Aug 24 15:53 repo
[root@rhel9 html]# 

Now we need to create a kickstart file as we see in xref:01-installation-using-ks.adoc[Using Kickstart files] but with some differences.

We can use https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadebustos/workshops-rhel9/master/documentation/modules/ROOT/assets/files/kickstart/edge-ks.cfg[this kickstart file] to provision the Edge server.

We have to use some especific kickstart configuration for Edge deployments. First, to configure Edge repositories, where the Commit tar image was uncompressed:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
ostreesetup --nogpg --url=http://192.168.122.1/ostree/repo/ --osname=rhel --remote=edge --ref=rhel/9/x86_64/edge

Where:

* **http://192.168.122.1/ostree/repo/** is the URL where the repo was uncompressed.

Users HOME directories are under **/var/home**. Due to CoreOS is an inmutable OS the user HOME directories will be placed under **/var/home** directory.
