== Deployment for RHEL in the Edge using Image Builder

This method offers you more control over the Edge image creation.

First of all you will have to deploy a RHEL server installing:

1. Cockpit (xref:02-management.adoc[RHEL Managament]).
2. Image Builder (xref:04-builder.adoc[Image Builder]).

When **Cockpit** and the **Image Builder** service are installed connect to Cockpit and go to Image Builder and create a blueprint for your Edge deployment as indicated in xref:04-builder-blueprints.adoc[Blueprints].

=== Using an ISO image to deploy the image

Once the blueprint has been created we need to create an image for the blueprint, in this case:

image::cockpit/11-create-blueprint.png[]

Once the image build has finished we can download the ISO file:

image::cockpit/14-create-blueprint.png[]

=== Deploying a commited image
