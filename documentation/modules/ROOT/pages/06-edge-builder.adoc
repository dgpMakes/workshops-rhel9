== Deployment for RHEL in the Edge using Image Builder

This method offers you more control over the Edge image creation.

First of all you will have to deploy a RHEL server installing:

1. Cockpit (xref:02-management.adoc[RHEL Managament]).
2. Image Builder (xref:04-builder.adoc[Image Builder]).

When **Cockpit** and the **Image Builder** service are installed connect to Cockpit and go to Image Builder and create a blueprint for your Edge deployment as indicated in xref:04-builder-blueprints.adoc[Blueprints].

=== Deploying a commited image

Once the blueprint has been created we need to create an image for the blueprint, in this case select **RHEL for Edge Commit (.tar)**:

image::edge-deployment/commit-01.png[]

And click on **Create**:

image::edge-deployment/commit-02.png[]

After the image creation we can download it:

image::edge-deployment/commit-04.png[]

TIP: We can download the image using the command line: xref:04-builder-cmdline.adoc[Using Image Builder from the command line].

As we can see we have two different images for the same template:

1. An ISO image.
2. The Commit tar image.

TIP: Once we have a blueprint we can create different images for different platforms using the same blueprint.

We need to publish the image using a http server so as explained in xref:01-installation-repositories.adoc[Network repositories] we deploy Apache and we will create a directory to publish the image:..

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[root@rhel9 ~]# cd /var/www/html
[root@rhel9 html]# mkdir ostree

We uncompress the image in that directory:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[root@rhel9 html]# tar xf /root/8a987451-c840-45b0-af12-3b3f575b5fd6-commit.tar -C /var/www/html/ostree
[root@rhel9 html]# ls -lhZ /var/www/html/ostree
