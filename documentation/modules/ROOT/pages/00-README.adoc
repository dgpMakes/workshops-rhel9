These workshops are intended to introduce to RHEL 9 new features and thus required some Linux and RHEL Knowledge. For instance, you will need to know how configure Red Hat repository and create them if necessary.

In each workshop within the **Resources** section you could find complementary information.

These workshops are a living environment and I will be including new stuff depending on my duties and free time.
