== Installing cockpit

To install software the RHEL 9 machine need to have access to RHEL repositories, so check that you have access to them:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[root@rhel9 ~]# dnf repolist
Updating Subscription Management repositories.
repo id                                                                            repo name
rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms                                                   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 for x86_64 - AppStream (RPMs)
rhel-9-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms                                                      Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 for x86_64 - BaseOS (RPMs)
[root@rhel9 ~]# 

To install **cockpit**:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[root@rhel9 ~]# dnf install cockpit -y
...
[root@rhel9 ~]# systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/sockets.target.wants/cockpit.socket â†’ /usr/lib/systemd/system/cockpit.socket.
[root@rhel9 ~]#

TIP: Check the official documentation for your RHEL version to get how cockpit is installed. The procedure may change between versions. https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html-single/managing_systems_using_the_rhel_9_web_console/index#installing-the-web-console_getting-started-with-the-rhel-9-web-console[How to install Cockpit]

To access the **cockpit** service you will need to open de **9090/tcp** port. This port should be opened during **cockpit** installation:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[root@rhel9 ~]# firewall-cmd --list-all
public (active)
  target: default
  icmp-block-inversion: no
  interfaces: enp1s0
  sources: 
  services: cockpit dhcpv6-client ssh
  ports: 8080-8083/tcp
  protocols: 
  forward: yes
  masquerade: no
  forward-ports: 
  source-ports: 
  icmp-blocks: 
  rich rules: 
[root@rhel9 ~]#

As you can see the service **cockpit** is opened you can access the service through https://<your rhel 9 ip>:9090 using a web browser:
