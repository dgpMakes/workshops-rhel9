== Using kickstart files from an Apache Server

To perform an unattended deployment we can boot from a RHEL iso, edit the boot commands and add the following **inst.ks=http://httpd-server/ks/custom-kickstart.ks**.

This will perform the installation according to the kickstart file included in the boot command line.

To perform an unattended deployment:

1. Create a Virtual Machine with at least 15 GB disk, 2 CPU and 4 GB of RAM.
2. Use the RHEL 9 Installation DVD to boot the Virtual Machine (rhel-baseos-9.0-x86_64-dvd.iso) as you will do to perform a manual installation.
3. At the boot menu select the **Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0** and press the **Tab** key to edit the boot options:

4. Add **inst.ks=http://192.168.122.1/ks/anaconda-ks.cfg** and press return to start the unattended deployment.

TIP: Replace the kickstart URL for your kickstart file URL.

The kickstart used in this example is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadebustos/workshops-rhel9/master/documentation/modules/ROOT/assets/files/kickstart/anaconda-ks.cfg[/root/anaconda-ks.cfg]. After finishing the deployment you will have to reboot the server manually.

You must take into consideration:

1. This is a simple kickstart example.
2. IP configuration is done using DHCP.
3. Root user can not be accessed by SSH (password is in kickstart comments).
4. The install DVD must be used due to there are no network repositories configured.

As kickstart files is not one of these workshops purposes so if you are not comfortable with kickstart files you should modify the above kickstart file to:

1. Create non-root users.
2. Provide passwordless sudo to some users.
3. Install additional software.
4. Perform custom disk partitioning.
5. Configure static network configuration.
