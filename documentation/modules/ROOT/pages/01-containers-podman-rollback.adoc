[#podmanrollback]
=== Performing automatic rollbacks

As podman is able to perform automatic rollbacks if there is some problem with the update automatic rollbacks are needed as well.

Podman will check the new downloaded container image and if the new container image does not work an automatic rollback will be performed to the previous working container image

=== How we will implement the automatic rollback

We will implement the automatic rollback in the following way:

image::serverless/podman-autoupdate-rollback.png[]

1. After the container image has been downloaded podman will check that the container image starts successfully.
2. If not, podman will automatically rollback to the previous working container image.

=== Creating a faulty image

We will create a faulty image. So create a new Dockerfile as the **workshop** user:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$ cat << EOF Dockerfile.2048.rhel9.v3
# buildah build -f Dockerfile.2048.rhel9.v3 -t 2048-demoday:v3
# podman run --rm -d -p 8080:8081 localhost/2048-demoday:v3
FROM registry.redhat.io/rhel9/nginx-120
MAINTAINER Jose Angel de Bustos <abustosp@redhat.com> 
COPY 2048 /opt/app-root/src
EXPOSE 8081
ENTRYPOINT ["exit", "255"]
EOF
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$

We build the container image:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$ buildah build -f Dockerfile.2048.rhel9.v3 -t 2048-demoday:v3
...
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$ podman images
REPOSITORY                          TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED       SIZE

[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$

=== Performing the rollback automatically

Tag the new image as the **latest** and upload it to the registry. Maybe you will need to perform a login in the registry:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$ podman tag localhost/2048-demoday:v3 quay.io/rhte_2019/2048-demoday:latest
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$ podman images
REPOSITORY                          TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED        SIZE
localhost/2048-demoday              v3          a9a607702567  58 seconds ago  382 MB
quay.io/rhte_2019/2048-demoday      latest      a9a607702567  58 seconds ago  382 MB
localhost/2048-demoday              v2          618f3cb61744  10 minutes ago  382 MB
localhost/2048-demoday              v1          d48137cd5225  5 hours ago    382 MB
registry.redhat.io/rhel9/nginx-120  latest      8b24fbc725c8  6 weeks ago    379 MB
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$ podman push quay.io/rhte_2019/2048-demoday:latest
...
[workshop@rhel9 Dockerfiles]$

To update the container image the container must be running. As we have deployed a serverless application maybe the container is not running.

First we are going to check the container images that are present for the **core** user and if there is some container running:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[core@rhel9 ~]$ podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                  COMMAND     CREATED         STATUS             PORTS                     NAMES
3b6c286c3cf8  quay.io/rhte_2019/2048-demoday:latest              24 seconds ago  Up 25 seconds ago  127.0.0.1:8080->8081/tcp  demoday
[core@rhel9 ~]$ 

We see that the container is running. After a while the container image will be updated:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[core@rhel9 ~]$ podman images
REPOSITORY                      TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED         SIZE
<none>                          <none>      a9a607702567  15 minutes ago  382 MB
quay.io/rhte_2019/2048-demoday  latest      618f3cb61744  3 weeks ago     382 MB
[core@rhel9 ~]$

We can see that the latest is pointing to the **IMAGE ID** for the v2 version and the image tagged as **<none>** is pointing to the v3 version (the faulty one). So podman has updated the image automatically as the image is a faulty one has performed an automatic rollback to the last working image.

=== Performing the rollback manually

We are going to restore the v2 image as the latest in the repository just to perform the upgrade manually:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[workshop@rhel9 ~]$ podman tag localhost/2048-demoday:v2 quay.io/rhte_2019/2048-demoday:latest
[workshop@rhel9 ~]$ podman push quay.io/rhte_2019/2048-demoday:latest
...
[workshop@rhel9 ~]$

Once the v2 version is uploaded as the **latest** version to the repository we are going to check manually if there is some updates available for the container:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[core@rhel9 ~]$ podman auto-update --dry-run
UNIT                     CONTAINER               IMAGE                                  POLICY      UPDATED
container-httpd.service  86566938f37c (demoday)  quay.io/rhte_2019/2048-demoday:latest  registry    false
[core@rhel9 ~]$ 

NOTE: The container has to be running. If the container is not running send some requests to the application using a browser.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
[core@rhel9 ~]$ podman images
REPOSITORY                      TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED         SIZE
<none>                          <none>      a9a607702567  15 minutes ago  382 MB
quay.io/rhte_2019/2048-demoday  latest      618f3cb61744  3 weeks ago     382 MB
[core@rhel9 ~]$ podman rmi a9a6
[core@rhel9 ~]$
[core@rhel9 ~]$
