=== Performing automatic rollbacks

As podman is able to perform automatic rollbacks if there is some problem with the update automatic rollbacks are needed as well.

Podman will check the new downloaded container image and if the new container image does not work an automatic rollback will be performed to the previous working container image

=== How we will implement the automatic rollback

We will implement the automatic rollback in the following way:

images::serverless/podman-autoupdate-rollback.png[]

1. After the container image has been downloaded podman will check that the container image starts successfully.
2. If not, podman will automatically rollback to the previous working container image.
