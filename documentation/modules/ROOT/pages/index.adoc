This project aims to be a recollection of workshops about RHEL 9, both "normal" and Edge. As you know RHEL 9 has two flavors:

1. RHEL 9
2. RHEL 9 (Edge)

=== RHEL 9

This is the RHEL version we all know available for several hardware architectures:

1. x86_64
2. ARM
3. IBM Power
4. IBM zSeries

=== RHEL 9 (Edge)

This is a new version designed for Edge computing cases which is based in an inmutable Operating System using rpm-ostree..
